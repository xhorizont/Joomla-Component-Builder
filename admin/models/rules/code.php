		/**
		 * My idea is to add some kind of validation to improve JCB code (per/language)
		 *
		 * So at this time this code validation is used for JavaScript,CSS,HTML and PHP.
		 * We can see what language is being worked on with the syntax property in the $element. (in JCB)
		 * What complicates things is the placeholders, of both custom code, component, and view names.
		 * Ideally we could strip them and then validate the code to being syntactically correct.
		 * But since some of the placeholders form part of the class/function names and the more, it seems like we are pressed for a much more advance solution.
		 * If you have any ideas to how we can go about to do this, then please open an issue on github and lets begin. (this is a nice to have, so don't break a leg...)
